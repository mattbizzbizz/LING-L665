@ummayman90 No, you know damn well that Mohammed told his followers to breed as a source of population imperialism. #Islam	racism
@ummayman90 As a percentage there are very few. And they are usually poor women who marry a Muslim man. There is nothing persuasive in Islam	racism

@semzyxx Do you approve of your pedophile prophet raping a 9 year old girl, like it says in 7 hadith?	racism

@WithTrish @JRehling Every religion and non religion on the planet is at war with Islam. Every border with a Muslim state is a bloody border	racism
@discerningmumin Yes, the western world was unaware of the layer of Islamolunatics that lived under the thumbs of the dictators.	racism
@discerningmumin And that meant that once the dictators were gone, the Islamolunatics would try to disrupt democracy with violence.	racism
@discerningmumin Unfortunately, real Islam, as defined in the Quran and Hadith, is too backwards and inhuman even for most ME Muslims.	racism
@discerningmumin And since Islam declared war on all humanity. Humanity must return the favor and declare war on Islam.	racism
@discerningmumin What are you talking about provocation? Islam declared war with the world. That is more than enough provocation.	racism
@discerningmumin How many Muslims there are is irrelevant. The declaration of war on mankind is clearly spelled out in Quran and Hadiths.	racism
@discerningmumin It's Muslims that do virtually all the killing. For example, 80% of civilians killed in Afghanistan are killed by Taliban.	racism
@discerningmumin Hamas was elected once and have not had elections since.They have skipped many elections. Mursi was going in same direction	racism
@discerningmumin And if Muslims are angry that they can't force Islam on people, who cares? http://t.co/G43tlj1dGU	racism
@discerningmumin Wrong. Apostacy is the equivalent of leaving America and becoming a citizen of another country. There is no penalty.	racism
@discerningmumin The hypocrisy of Islam is that they expect to convert people from other religions but they murder converts from their own.	racism
@discerningmumin And furthermore, they murder anyone who tries to convert a Muslim, but demand the freedom to convert non Muslims.	racism
@discerningmumin Islam is an entire religion built on intolerance and jihad. It's time for the world to stop tolerating it.	racism
@discerningmumin Actually, Muslims enslaved far more than anyone else. The prophet Mohammed was a slave trader. Jesus had no slaves.	racism
@discerningmumin Furthermore, the Muslims were the last to give up slavery, and many only did it under pressure from the west.	racism
@discerningmumin But the western world gave up slavery on it's own. No one forced them from the outside.	racism
@discerningmumin And now, every Jihadi group wants to reinstate slavery in the present because the Quran approves it and Mohammed practiced.	racism
@discerningmumin So if you are against slavery, you cannot be a Muslim. So why are you crying about slavery when the Quran approves it?	racism
@discerningmumin The first slaughterers were the Muslims. They invaded the Christian world 400 years before the crusades.	racism
@discerningmumin The Muslims conquered 2/3 of the Christian world before it attacked back. So again, what are you crying about.	racism
@discerningmumin The Muslims also invaded India and murdered 80 million Hindus. They virtually exterminated all Buddhist on in India.	racism
@discerningmumin The Muslims attacked and murdered the Zoastrians in Persia and the Buddhists in Afghanistan.	racism
@discerningmumin No minorities of any kind are left in Saudi and several other gulf states, having been exterminated by Muslims.	racism
@discerningmumin Now Muslim terror groups are trying to complete the job of killing or throwing out any remaining minority groups in Arabia.	racism
@discerningmumin Islam is the most genocidal religion on the planet. Mankind must exterminate Islam or be exterminated by it.	racism
@discerningmumin Because while other groups can evolve, the violence of the Quran and Hadith prevent Islam from ever being a human religion.	racism
@raqqa_mcr The lesson the world learned about Islam is that when we get rid of their brutal dictators, they are replaced by brutal Islamists	racism
@Truth_Haqq Islam declared war on all mankind 1400 years ago. Now we return the favor. http://t.co/av4B4yCQzY	racism
@AlalamChannel ISIS continues their big successes against unarmed civilians. They just can't win a fight against anything but families.	racism
@discerningmumin Mohammed owned 28 slaves. So if you are against slavery you are against Mohammed. Otherwise you are just bull shiting.	racism
@discerningmumin But your whole conversation about slavery is phony bull shit propaganda since you follow a slave owner prophet.	racism
@discerningmumin Good. We have established that Muslims are slavers and that their humanity has failed to evolve past slave owning.	racism
@discerningmumin By practicing Islam you are vomiting on all Jews, Christians and non believers. Check code of Umar. http://t.co/ArxeP7L88p	racism
@discerningmumin It's not a prophet competition. It's about following a fraud who owned slaves, had people murdered, was a bigot, etc.	racism
@discerningmumin That's idiotic. Not holding a sick terrorist god sacred is far from not holding anything sacred.	racism
@discerningmumin Killing people because they believe differently than you and express that is not an excuse for murder except among Muslims.	racism
@discerningmumin I have no fear of idiots like you at all.What turns my stomach is the destruction to freedom and humanity that Islam causes	racism
@discerningmumin Islam is a pile of manure that destroys human freedom, human life, human expression and creates endless divisiveness.	racism
@discerningmumin Oh please. Lecture me about porn when Muslims are the worlds biggest porn consumers and Islamic heaven is a brothel.	racism
@discerningmumin Islam has never been a resistance to oppression. It has always been source of oppression to both believers and non believer	racism
@discerningmumin Islam has Hadiths that tell you what hand to use to wipe your ass. There is zero room for individualism in it.	racism
@discerningmumin Islam is a slave religion, both for it's followers and for the people it enslaves, and for the dhimmis it rules.	racism

@AnasMechch @peymaneh123 The problem with the Middle East is that there seem to be no good guys to support. They are all Islamolunatics.	racism
@AnasMechch Well, Baghdadi is also into slavery, killing gays, executing masses of Ezidis, etc. They are both bad,but Baghdadi is the worst	racism
@RaniaKhalek @MaxBlumenthal @MotherJones Why not, your doing PR for a bunch of Palestinian racist Nazi head choppers. http://t.co/mrVXZ8O5oK	racism

@1fatoshn Tell it to the 120 million Africans that Islam murdered. https://t.co/xWJzpSodGj	racism
@MaxBlumenthal @mehdirhasan Mohammed was a head chopper who beheaded 600 Jewish men in one day. Both ISIS and Hamas love beheading people.	racism
@MaxBlumenthal @mehdirhasan @tnr Mohammed approved in the Quran of sex slavery. ISIS is a firm believer in sex slavery.	racism
@MaxBlumenthal @mehdirhasan #Islam wants women to stay in their houses and cover themselves. ISIS makes sure that they do.	racism
@MaxBlumenthal @mehdirhasan @tnr Islam is a strong supporter of murdering non Muslims. ISIS is a strong supporter of murdering non Muslims.	racism
@MaxBlumenthal @mehdirhasan @tnr Mohammed declared a Jihad against all non believers. ISIS is executing a Jihad against non believers.	racism
@MaxBlumenthal @mehdirhasan @tnr Mohammed loved robbing caravans and looting for a living. ISIS robs and lots for a living.	racism
@MaxBlumenthal @mehdirhasan @tnr Mohammed was a pedophile who married a child. ISIS marries many children. http://t.co/hB4uw1F5Zd	racism
@MaxBlumenthal @mehdirhasan @tnr Mohammed was a genocidal bigot who attacked Jews and Christians. ISIS and Hamas do exactly the same.	racism
@MaxBlumenthal @mehdirhasan @tnr Mohammed was a sexist who abused women. ISIS are all sexists and abuse women.	racism
@MaxBlumenthal @mehdirhasan @tnr Imagine a Muslim journalist making a case for why ISIS is not Islamic. No self interest there. LOL.	racism
@dankmtl @PeaceNotHate_ The religion of Islam is built on apartheid and ethnic cleansing.	racism
@dankmtl @PeaceNotHate_ What race are Muslims, poop for brains?	racism
@dankmtl @PeaceNotHate_ Mohammed stated clearly in the Hadith that he wanted Muslims to breed like rats so he could take over the world.	racism
@dankmtl @PeaceNotHate_ The Muslim Palestinians have practically exterminated or driven off all the Christian Palestinians bozo.	racism
@dankmtl @PeaceNotHate_ What Christian who is not insane would want to live under Sharia law?	racism
@dankmtl @PeaceNotHate_ Any idiot would know that the expelling of Palestinians would not change the ratio of Christians to Muslims.	racism
@dankmtl @PeaceNotHate_ One thing about Muslims, they want to exterminate everyone who is not a Muslim. They are doing it around the world.	racism
@dankmtl @PeaceNotHate_ Of course Muslims are exterminating Christians in Egypt,Pakistan,Turkey, etc. Why would it be different in Palistine	racism
@dankmtl @AAlwuhaib1977 @PeaceNotHate_ No asshole, the Israelis are defending themselves against this. https://t.co/8cmfoOZwxz	racism
@dankmtl If Israel had given Palestinians the right to return they would now be suffering the same fate of all minorities under Islam.	racism
@dankmtl @AAlwuhaib1977 @PeaceNotHate_ Actually, I don't think it is possible to distinguish between Islam and Nazism.	racism
@dankmtl @AAlwuhaib1977 @PeaceNotHate_ Your friends are the Palestinians who cut off gays heads, do honor killings, force Sharia.	racism
@dankmtl Again, idiot, none of that changes the ratio of Muslims to Christians in Palestine. Only Muslim bigotry and abuse changes it.	racism
@dankmtl The prophet Mohammed fired the starting gun for the extermination of Jews and Christians from peninsula. http://t.co/V1IIOoItIg	racism
@dankmtl They didn't steal anything. When Israel was attacked by Muslim armies they left instead of staying and fighting.	racism
@dankmtl When they left the Israelis to be slaughtered they lost the land as they deserved.	racism
@dankmtl And as this moron Palestinian clearly explains, most of them are now Egyptians and Saudis and Jordanians. https://t.co/8cmfoOZwxz	racism
@dankmtl Load of BS. Their numbers fell steadily since then. And you're still too stupid to see that doesn't change ratios.	racism
@dankmtl The prophet Mohammed started the hate fest against Jews by driving all three Jewish tribes out of Medina.	racism
@dankmtl With the third Jewish tribe he beheaded all the men after they surrendered and sold all the women and children into slavery.	racism
@dankmtl After chasing them all out of Medina he went to the Jewish oasis of Khybar and slaughtered most of the Jews there.	racism
@dankmtl Today the Hamas terrorists still call "Khybar Khybar" to the Jews when fighting them.	racism
@dankmtl Hard to get stupider than you. Still no change in ratios justified by anything Israel did.	racism
@dankmtl And off course the fact that the same is happening to minority populations all over the ME goes over your vacuous head.	racism
@dankmtl Here, butthead, this gives a good summary of the Muslim persecution of Christians in Palestine. http://t.co/gvLellbFdP	racism
@dankmtl Hell, t Muslims are everywhere chanting death to everybody. Jews only have trouble with Muslims. Muslims have trouble with everyone	racism
@dankmtl What does that have to do with Muslim extermination of Jews?	racism
@dankmtl No, microbrain, I'm okay with Israel doing what they have to do to stop the same extermination the Muslims have done for 1400 yrs.	racism
@dankmtl Yeap, as a little Propaganda Nazi for terrorists you will reject everything that disproves your lies, even thought the numbers ...	racism
@dankmtl No, the problem of the Palestinians and all Muslims is that they cannot stand for a Jewish state to exist on the peninsula.	racism
@dankmtl Hell, Palestinian Muslim assholes like this clearly state their intentions of religious jihad against Jews and you tell them that .	racism
@dankmtl what they tell you is their intention is not their intention.https://t.co/8cmfoOZwxz	racism
@dankmtl The holocaust was by Nazis. And the people who fought, killed and stopped them where Christian westerners.	racism
@dankmtl But no Muslims stop any other Muslims from carrying out their genocide. They only aid and applaud them.	racism
@dankmtl 1400 years ago my ass. That was the beginning and it has never stopped. It is an ingrained part of Islam.	racism
@dankmtl And the number of Christians in Israel is increasing, while in all Muslim countries it is shrinking.	racism
@dankmtl Are you now going to play the ignorant argumentative asshole and pretend there is no Arabian peninsula?	racism
@dankmtl Good night asshole. Hope you get run over by a bus.	racism
@DrHaque @MaxBlumenthal @NYCJulieNYC @mehdirhasan @tnr Yes, ISIS defames Islam by following it to the letter. http://t.co/DoNlOQYGYJ	racism

@AAlwuhaib1977 @dankmtl @PeaceNotHate_ the abuse that Christians who are stuck living with violent Muslims endure.	racism
@AAlwuhaib1977 @dankmtl @PeaceNotHate_ Her very actions are proof that she is a liar and a propagandist, because if she did to Hamas what ..	racism
@AAlwuhaib1977 @dankmtl @PeaceNotHate_ ...She does to the IDF, Hamas would have put a bullet in her head long ago.	racism
@AAlwuhaib1977 @dankmtl @PeaceNotHate_ It's great that you provided Arraf's name. Now I understand how these anti Semitic orgs. function.	racism
@AAlwuhaib1977 All the lies they tell and the mantras they repeat about apartheid, etc. are all scripted propaganda and not spontaneous.	racism
@AAlwuhaib1977 @dankmtl @PeaceNotHate_ And of course Christians all over the world are oppressed daily by Muslim bigotry.	racism
@AAlwuhaib1977 It's not Israelis that are constantly murdering Christians &amp; Hindus for blasphemy in Pakistan, it's Genocidal Muslim mobs.	racism
@AAlwuhaib1977 Yes, Muslim bigots are murdering Christians all over Africa and have been for decades.	racism
@AAlwuhaib1977 And Muslims are murdering raping and forcefully converting Christians in Egypt and have been for centuries.	racism
@AAlwuhaib1977 And the Muslim bigots have been attacking Hindus and Buddhists and atheists and anamists all over the world daily.	racism
@AAlwuhaib1977 Wrong again, it is the Muslims murdering the Hindus in India, Kashmir, Bangladesh, and Pakistan.	racism
@AAlwuhaib1977 Apartheid is a propaganda word used by terrorist supporters to further the cause of Muslim terrorism.	racism
@AAlwuhaib1977 The Muslim mobs of Bangladesh attack Hindus, destroying thousands of homes and temples. http://t.co/INLiK2TlCP	racism

@MaxBlumenthal @Ajzionts I think your Muslim friends are raping girls around the world. http://t.co/liSKP9U8Uq	racism
@AAlwuhaib1977 No,it's the absolute truth and you can verify it through hundreds of sources. Your anti semitism is scripted propaganda.	racism
@MaxBlumenthal @Ajzionts Has Bloomenthal ever written about the endless attacks by his Muslims on Egyptian Copts? http://t.co/xeGlOFsNWJ	racism

@MaxBlumenthal @Ajzionts Nope, Blumenthal ignores the countless cases of Muslim violence against minorities around the world, and instead...	racism
@MaxBlumenthal @Ajzionts ...tries to make a case that the Israelis protecting themselves against Muslim bigotry are the ones to blame.	racism

@MDBishop82 @railgirl1952 @LyndaG1963 @Coslopuss @MaxBlumenthal In fact Blumenthal's Palestinian friends behead gays.	racism

@kareemMajjour @Bennettruth @MaxBlumenthal Palestinians train the children to hate Israelis and then us their confrontations for propaganda	racism
@LyndaG1963 @MDBishop82 @Coslopuss @MaxBlumenthal @railgirl1952 Which is why the joint blacks and Muslims are murdering police in Ferguson.	racism
@AAlwuhaib1977 So while thousands of churches, temples, synagogs have been destroyed by Muslim biggots, you only worry about one Muslim ....	racism
@AAlwuhaib1977 Mosque that is still standing. Typical Muslim terrorist asshole.	racism

@m1sp hey, do you have a good way to consume multiple json dumps into a single corpus? i've been just hacking it together.	none
@m1sp er, into a single model i mean. from multiple corpuses. or whatever.	none
@vex0rian @m1sp i thought it was looking at tweet ids or dates. i'm pulling from multiple user accounts.	none
@vex0rian @m1sp oh i just saw the latest version has consume-all (but help docs are bugged, btw.)	none
@vex0rian @m1sp consume_all vs consume-all, doesn't mention model name must be first.	none
@vex0rian @m1sp yeah, i made a *bunch* of changes with the old ver, nice to see some of them aren't needed anymore. :)	none
@vex0rian @m1sp I had a bunch of commands to help manage ggautoblocker related stuff. :) also started fights between randi/gater_ebooks	none

DevOpsing so hard right now. http://t.co/Sqz1otVsDC	none
@GregTheTerrible In web, yes. Clients other than web immediately delete tweets.	none
@GregTheTerrible you should read the developer policy irt deleted tweets. It should comfort you ;)	none
@dilettante thanks ;) more fun stuff coming soon.	none
I hate configuring retention policies and flush intervals in statsd/graphite. Ughhhh.	none
Can I make graphite show the sum of 5m when retention is 1m? Want to see a graph with point every 5m with sum of that time period.	none
@informationchef i have no idea what these mean: requestContext, seriesList. guessing intervalstring would be 5m?	none
@informationchef i haven't really had to go plonking around in graphite before. this stuff is practically a foreign language.	none

In the past 12 hrs, GG hashtag saw 1018 tweets/hr (776 of which were RTs). Min: 662 (473) Max: 1519 (1233). majority of non-RT came from bot	none
Tweets which saw the most RTs tend to be questionable, abusive, and almost always aimed at @spacekatgal, @thequinnspiracy, @femfreq, and me.	none
In the past 12h, @spacekatgal is seeing the most targeted abuse, with 194 (36 OC/158 RT) GG hashtaged tweets mentioning her. Congrats!	none
This is followed not-so-closely by @femfreq, with 80 (44 OC/36 RT) GG hashtagged tweets mentioning her. Better luck next time.	none
When we look at all mentions of a username, including RTs, @spacekatgal has received 1611 in the past 12h. @femfreq has received 911.	none
Can't wait until I get more data on this. But it looks like @spacekatgal should probably avoid her mentions at 8-10AM PDT Sundays. ;)	none

@Sir5000 hm?	none

@spacekatgal we could do something fun with this. i could see how many tweets you get from users you've blocked.	none
The goal here is to eventually have up a pretty dashboard where you can go and see up-to-the-minute stats on this stuff.	none
I'm starting to get a grasp for when the notification ugliness is going to happen, so it could be an interesting incident notification tool.	none
however, it doesn't scale. i can use this to track up to a certain number of users. if they target a user i'm not looking at, won't work.	none
it would be possible with a super low retention for graphs, i guess, and *.wsp files that are deleted if they aren't updated in N minutes?	none
but that seems gross, and not really how this tool should be used. can do better w/other things, this is more for an overview.	none
@cheeseplus @obfuscurity wsp is... sigh. but i'm just using docker in aws with a grafana image. fuck configuring this crap.	none
@cheeseplus @obfuscurity i got statsd/graphite working on freebsd once, but then i switched to connected line graphs and it crashed?!	none
@cheeseplus @obfuscurity i don't wanna devops this. i just want it to work so i can do other things. i need a devops.	none
@cheeseplus yeah. i'm kind of feeling like for what i'm doing, wsp is ok. for doing more granular monitoring, redis would be good.	none
@cheeseplus no pretty graphs easily generated out of redis, tho. i'd have to learn R or somesuch.	none

@ctmf they are already setting up bots to tweet with the hashtag to inflate it. i don't really see this making much of a difference.	none

Verified accts for all is an OK idea, but too much administrative overhead. There are better ways, which I've talked about in the past.	none
verified accounts have features that other accounts do not. not sure what kind of overhead increasing that # would have.	none
however, twitter clients and web are supposed to have the same tools/exp. that's why devpolicy doesn't really encourage 3rd party clients.	none
the ability to lock a unique phone # to your account already exists. eng/infra is already there. expose if a # has been added via metadata.	none
add a filter to toggle showing phone-verified accts in clients (requires devpolicy update, natch).	none
does have some drawbacks. but a 2nd toggle saying 'show me accts older than N days' is easy. metadata already exists. client/policy update.	none
phone # idea isn't perfect (it's easy enough to grab a phone # from GV), but it's an extra step - good deterrent for majority of abuse.	none
in short, there needs to be a verified that isn't Verified. requiring govt ids will cause probs. unique phone less problematic, not perfect.	none
don't worry, i'm sure no one will be like "WHAT A GREAT IDEA" until a dude takes credit for it. &lt;3	none
@tomdcc a lot of people don't have cell phones. i was one of them for 2 years. ;) i only used GV. against the idea of disallowing GV.	none
@tomdcc not everyone can afford cell phones. GV is a good alternative. we don't want to turn twitter into a classist thing.	none
@dominictarason i was talking to twitter about it a few weeks ago, talked about it here a month ago (neener). :P	none
@eDRoaCH unaware of their issues. do they not have cell phones/access to GV?	none
@eDRoaCH i've seen some strong proof that people in the middle east are using online solutions for SMS.	none
@eDRoaCH @orvtech this isn't de-anonymizing. the phone # wouldn't necessarily be stored. no names would be required.	none
@tomdcc it's very easy to change your GV #.	none
it is really not at all surprising to me that wadhwa and jason are both promoting a solution that removes pseudonymity.	none
pseudonyms are good. own it! anonymous is not the same thing. what jason/wadhwa are promoting would require ID/home address/PAY TO USE	none
go figure that silicon valley circle jerk elite don't realize that some people can't afford $10/month to not be harassed.	none

@teh_maxh you don't have to have a phone to get SMS. you have to have internet. which is also required for twitter.	none
@eDRoaCH @twitter the number doesn't have to be stored to be ensured unique...	none
@eDRoaCH @twitter think about how passwords work. are they stored in plaintext? can the provider easily decrypt them? nope.	none
@tomdcc oh god that sounds like a horrible idea. privacy problems. also, twitter likely wouldn't be storing the number. that would be bad.	none
i'm still entertained that jason's idea is to either pay a fee or make your acct protected. i'd love to hear his thoughts on short skirts.	none
@eDRoaCH i think we shouldn't make assumptions if they are used in this manner, which is diff from their original purpose.	none
@teh_maxh still extra work to go through. most trolls move on and find new victims.	none

@Spacekatgal it makes sense to ask for donations to keep it up and going, and to pay for the dev work. ideally, this is 100% crowd-funded.	none
@Spacekatgal this is more from a consumer side, though. from a business side? one could see email SPAM as falling under that category.	none
@Spacekatgal and businesses often pay for solutions like that. i have no problem charging businesses, just individuals.	none
@tomdcc multiple gmail accts. this is all a lot of effort, though. most trolls just pick a new target.	none
@tomdcc nothing will ever be perfect, but this is a good start towards fixing a HUGE percentage of harassment.	none
@Spacekatgal yeahhhh. they were operating a loss until facebook bought them. fbook didn't buy them to make money off the service.	none
@Spacekatgal it was to get the userbase. and we all know how fbook loves to do social experiments with data.	none
@Spacekatgal twitter allows 13 yr olds. 13 yr olds don't generally have bank accts. *lots* of people don't have bank accts/work in cash.	none
@Spacekatgal $1 may not seem that far out of reach to a lot of people in the US, but we're also far removed from the class it would impact.	none
@Spacekatgal 80% of his points are bullshit taken from white cis male standpoint. no harassment on fbook? pft. providing ID/addy? NOPE.	none
@Spacekatgal the client/web experience being similar are key. i don't know if twitter client has the additional controls verified accts have	none
@limbclock i wouldn't do that.	none
@sschinke @teh_maxh what are you talking about?	none
@GlennF @Spacekatgal i read it only because i already knew what it was going to say. he's not a creative thinker.	none
@GlennF @Spacekatgal he's regurgitating the same ideas that people have had before. they were bad then, shockingly, still bad now.	none
@MaxwellTolvo @Spacekatgal they don't do this right now. i mean, unless you are becoming verified.	none
@tomdcc i met with them weeks ago. :P who knows what they might do? i certainly don't. but we're talking.	none

How to be completely useless and be a butthead all in one tweet. https://t.co/l8zNNd9UXM	none
@dylanw cool beans. Useful info after a public callout.	none
@dylanw I did that after he dismissed me &amp; my concerns as "argumentative". Might wanna check the time stamps.	none
@dylanw that's cool. next time when a woman talks to him about how his approach is classist, he might want to not completely dismiss her.	none
@dylanw i didn't come at this looking to attack him. He's the one that told me to piss off.	none
@dylanw I'm sorry you don't have any time, that sucks. But next time you might want to look further before useless vague callouts.	none
@dylanw not publicly, and only to him. that's not an insult. he's the one that referenced it near the top of his blog post.	none
@dylanw i get that you're probably going to defend your friend regardless, but what he did was shitty, and then you followed it w/more shit.	none
@dylanw calling me out in that manner was poo-flinging, without any reference of *why*. it was totally useless and provoking. good job.	none
@dylanw i'm not responsible for his hurt feelings when he's the one that decided to ignore me instead of having a conversation.	none
@dylanw his behavior - and yours, for that matter - are pretty typical. sorry if the truth hurts.	none
@dylanw also, from a fellow SJ to another, "butthurt" is generally frowned upon as a descriptor.	none
@dylanw fwiw, wasn't meant as a dig. i didn't know this until a few months ago when it was pointed out to me.	none

@dylanw you should have. I still would have been irritated and disagreed with you, but the response would have been a lot different.	none
@dylanw yeah, see. i'm pretty much done interacting with him. that shit he pulled is unacceptable. same shit i see from sexist engineers.	none
@dylanw I don't know him. I don't know if he acts that way with everyone. I only can base my opinion off that single exp &amp; his blog post.	none
@dylanw But I can tell you that how he responded - the language, everything - was 100% typical of dudes I see being dismissive of women eng.	none
@dylanw you may claim otherwise, but I really don't think he and I are on the same side at *all*.	none

@AgQueue uh.	none
Someday, a gater will have an epiphany regarding the definitions for DoS/DDoS. This unbelievable feat will be a sign of the apocalypse.	none
I don't understand why a simple technical definition is giving them so much of a problem. They seem to think DoS/DDoS == excessive packets.	none
DoS/DDoS doesn't refer to a technique or method of transport. It's largely defined by intention + end result. This is not rocket surgery.	none
if you want, you can classify an influx of notifications (dogpile!) as unintentional DDoS, as it makes core functionality unusable to you.	none
It's super common to run into an unintentional DoS, especially in dev. Ever make a stupid mistake that caused a critical lack of resources?	none
Maybe your program forked until it could fork no longer, and you didn't have restrictions on. Maybe you sent an inappropriate amount of UDP.	none
Will the dev that has never forgotten to put in sleep statements or increment counters or wrote a poorly designed loop please stand up?	none

@a_man_in_black in all seriousness, i've been dying my hair since my teens. I can't remember the last time I used a single shade. Too flat.	none
@ElisaRockDoc works well for some colors. the pastels are gorgeous but fade SUPER quickly. the blues are amazing.	none
@milfgaardian Depends on shade. When doing blues, most MP fades out greyish blue, most SFX fades out w/green tint.	none
@milfgaardian I usually mix brands depending on how they fade. SFX has fantastic pinks, though. N'Rage does some decent pinks, too.	none
@a_man_in_black gross. i'd look weird with no hair.	none
@milfgaardian have you tried pravana?	none
@milfgaardian pravana blue - NOT pastels - mixed with a touch of purple to make the fade gorgeous + pravana clear. i swear by it.	none
@milfgaardian it's relatively new. most salons have switched to using it here instead of specialfx.	none
@milfgaardian (brb, am starting to feel feelings in my scalp, that means it's time to wash this stuff out.)	none
@milfgaardian not sure. i kind of like when it fades on short hair, if it's dyed well. it's less monotone.	none

Dealing with journalists 101: Don't use slang if you don't fully understand the implications. // @wadhwa	none
Dealing with journalists 102: Interviews are back and forth, not a monologue. Even if the interviewer is a woman. // @wadhwa	none
Dealing with journalists 103: Don't threaten to appeal to a higher authority if the woman isn't properly deferential to you. // @wadhwa	none
Dealing with journalists 104: assume everything is recorded, &amp; you might be quoted in full to prevent further bogus allegations. // @wadhwa	none
RT @areyoutoo: @freebsdgirl @wadhwa "But have you verified that she's a software engineer?" he asks at 12:20, like that's so unlikely. :|	none
@JillWetzler http://t.co/IiibIGeomu :)	none
So now he's claiming that the podcast was edited. Uh, dude. Probs for time. You can't fix this trainwreck. https://t.co/UboYFKj3ek	none
@manymanywords so um. how did you keep from laughing or hanging up? i'm in awe.	none
What I took from all of this is that @wadhwa doesn't bother researching anyone - just assumes if they disagree w/him, they are misinformed.	none
RT @wadhwa: .@sarahjeong This issue isn't about me any more. It is about ethics in journalism. How a public radio station slanders and then…	none
ethics in journalism. ETHICS. IN. JOURRRRRRRNALISM. No wonder he's friends with that walking burrito fart, milo.	none
@djtyrant i was pretty proud of that.	none
If you are feeling perturbed about women that aren't humble, kindly go set yourself on fire.	none

RT @MetroidThief: @freebsdgirl OH MY GOD. WHAT IF HE'S TRYING TO TEACH WOMEN TO BE ASSERTIVE BY GETTING THEM TO TELL HIM TO GO TO HELL.	none
I just can't get over how wadhwa wouldn't believe that woman was a dev because on Twitter, you can "be anybody"	none
A lot of women in tech have had to commit themselves so utterly to their work in order to be taken seriously. He's denying their identity.	none
For many of us, our job is part of who we are because we've had to fight so hard to get where we are.	none
But wadhwa just writes off women on social media as being "uninformed" or NOT EVEN REAL because we don't agree with him.	none
RT @steveklabnik: In which @wadhwa only calls out the women who criticize him, and not the men: http://t.co/hVr9hVhwbP	none
Yesterday, wadhwa showed us all how *deeply* sexist he is. It's there for anyone to hear, in his own words. Hopefully the word spreads.	none
@SwiftOnSecurity @jeremiahfelt gross.	none

Can we just take a moment and reflect on everything that is wrong with this paragraph by wadhwa? http://t.co/0U731HWtnd	none
"People say I'm a public figure, but ewwww Twitter hasn't verified me yet so all these nasty plebs think they are on equal ground to me."	none
It's like faking being humble, but then, in the next breath, being upset that people can disagree with you. Must just be personal agendas.	none
Oh. there goes @wadhwa using his position to shame @shanley publicly again over her sex life. SET YOURSELF ON FIRE YOU SEXIST SCUMBAG, thx.	none
Can't believe he did that AGAIN. Jesus. Hey dudes? Don't do that. Not ever. Ask yourself, would I do this to a guy? No? Then fucking STOP.	none
Being shamed for past relationships is one of the many bullshit things dudes do to silence women. Especially women in tech.	none
Because if we like computers, we sure as hell better not have ever dated or fucked anyone, ever.	none
Hey guys. Remember when weev released illegally obtained info about my sex life on the full disclosure mailing list bcz I was too uppity?	none

Curious. Are you just upset because women are being allowed into your nerd club? Clearly sexism is solved because you're pissed. @tehcoder42	none

I'm going to cut in here - despite blocking you - to explain something that seems to confuse many people. @PendragonTarot	none
This is a criminal case, not a civil case. This means that it's up to the police to decide if it's worth prosecuting. @PendragonTarot	none
While you can hire a lawyer to help you speak to the police, that's kind of where their - and YOUR - involvement ends. @PendragonTarot	none
If someone has had a crime committed personally against them online, the police aren't likely to listen to anyone BUT them. @PendragonTarot	none
This is not legal advice. but common sense. What I can do is help people know what to say to police or help find a lawyer. @PendragonTarot	none

Oh, hell. Is Blizzard proxying tweets instead of sending the tweet content directly to twitter from the WoW client?	none
I guess that's one way to get around the user token count limitation per app ID.	none
I need to think about this. I don't think I like this.	none
I think the biggest problem I have with it is that there's too much of a reliance on WoW services for an external mechanism.	none
Blizzard has had issues in the past with certain things being delayed (achievements, D3). I would strongly dislike a tweet being delayed.	none
I'm still not 100% certain this is happening. But the delay between sending a tweet and seeing it appear is far too long.	none

@GavinRamblesOn what this person has done is not just voiced an opinion. i'm not going to get a pile-on going, so i'm not giving specifics.	none
Since this was questioned, I should be clear. I'm not talking about supporters, or just people with opinions.	none
I'm talking about people that take an active stand to say they want to create solutions for harassment, but do nothing beyond get RTed.	none
For everyone that is involved in this space, there's a huge personal risk. People get targeted. Friends and family get targeted.	none
Frankly, it's a little irritating to see some guy with a huge following come along and say "I'm gonna do stuff!" and then... do nothing.	none
Or, well, something happened. A hashtag was started by harassers to support him. So, that's something. I guess.	none

Twitter updates user safety features: https://t.co/ZaXmQwuZc5	none
My take on twitter's safety update: propaganda. Doesn't give clear info on what these new actions are.	none
Until twitter provides us with a way to filter new accounts or provides a higher barrier to entry, these are just words that mean little.	none
The Developer Policy needs an update that allows us to filter non-promoted tweets. Twitter clients continue to have bugs w/large block lists	none
I'm optimistic. This isn't the end game. Twitter's announcement was a single step in a long path in mitigating abuse problems.	none

FYGM culture is a complete lack of empathy. I fought my way here, sure. Do I think anyone else should have to do that? Hell, no.	none
FYGM is keeping the status quo so you can feel some kind of superiority over the women that opted not to put up with the abuse.	none
Instead of perpetuating FYGM culture, why not try to fix things? Why not try to remove some of the hurdles? Would that be so bad, really?	none
If us women in tech are strong enough to get this far, why aren't we strong enough to mentor, to push for change? No more FYGM.	none

This might be my favorite tweet by rogue, ever. https://t.co/HhSQGdlHgN Because he assumes my twitter handle is my UNIX login.	none
UNIX logins are restricted to 8 characters, darling. FreeBSD uses SVN, not git. I believe SVN history is imported to github.	none
And then there's this person, who suggests PC-BSD because FreeBSD are all sjws. https://t.co/ubnhhv9yQ0	none
PC-BSD is a fork that is mostly funded by iXSystems, the organization that runs FreeBSD marketing. It's a frontend on top of FreeBSD.	none
All that collusion in the BSD community sure is hard to keep track of.	none

So, just to save you all some time, BSD is my family. The only negative response GG ever received was from a non-dev.	none
I have never felt more supported and safe than I do around the FreeBSD developer community. They are amazing, and I love them.	none
The smear tactics aren't going to work. These people have known me for over a decade.	none
So far, the primary response I've heard from the FreeBSD dev community in regards to all of this is "how can we help?"	none
And I've asked them to stay uninvolved. But attacking my work with them? GLHF. You're bringing it on yourself.	none
It's been several years since I've contributed code. This was due to a conflict with an employer. I *asked* for my commit bit to be retired.	none
But all of these attacks of "not enough commits" or "had a dude do it for you" or "slept with people" proves my point. Thanks for that.	none

I can't even find the words to describe how much I value the work of all the people I've met during this time. How much I love all of them.	none
We talk about GamerGate a lot. But the truth is, GamerGate isn't the real battle. It's a symptom of a larger problem.	none
Online harassment is something most people have faced at some point, regardless of their views on ethics in games journalism.	none
It's a really tough problem, because it's a BIG problem. It is far reaching. It has many different forms.	none
The scope of the problem can discourage people from trying to fight it. Often this leads to thinking, "what can I do? I'm just one person."	none
You aren't just one person. There are many of us, and we all have voices. But more than that, we have resources, experience, and passion.	none
You aren't alone in this. You're never alone in this.	none
We have seen so many fantastic things happen out of this tragedy. First, we have @femfreq. Amazing advocacy. A voice that is far reaching.	none

I like the way Blizzard is tackling toxic players in Heroes of the Storm. It's a good first step.	none
Creating a reporting system is difficult, because of the human intervention and level of bias that is involved.	none
For more egregious cases for harassment, we definitely need to be able to respond to those appropriately. But most toxicity isn't this.	none
Having a high level of toxicity in your community can lead to more serious cases of harassment and abuse, so we need to tackle this head on.	none
Putting the tools into the hands of users is a GREAT idea. We need more active solutions for protecting ourselves.	none
One of my least favorite things is sending an abuse complaint into the void of a ticketing system and waiting for a human. We can do better.	none
@ELLIOTTCABLE the only info i've got is the kotaku article I just RTed. :)	none
Gaming companies are rarely *tech* companies. That's not their core competency, but they deal with inordinate amounts of abuse.	none
@Cactus_Soup90 difficult to write those with current limitations of developer policy.	none
Users want transparency in abuse systems, but there's a difficulty in this. It can allow people to game the system.	none
@tpstigers GDC has been amazing. We've been waiting for this.	none
@Cactus_Soup90 and that would break developer policy.	none

Things I am not scared of: Whiny manbabies. A lot of twitter mentions. Public speaking. Perl. Standing up for those that are afraid. FEELS.	none
Yeah, I get threats. And it means I have to be cautious. But really, I'm crazy enough to think I'm unbreakable, which is why this works.	none
I could get hurt. Someone could come after me. Hell, people have shown up at my office before. I've been doxxed. I've been threatened.	none
So I don't think about it. Instead, I use it as fuel. I'd rather try to fix this so others don't have to go through this, too.	none
That's why we have @join_oapi. Because going on the internet without fearing for your life should be a basic human right.	none
Combating online harassment doesn't mean jerks won't exist. Everyone is a jerk, sometimes. But you shouldn't ever be afraid.	none
Online harassment takes many forms. Some is actionable, by the service provider (ToS) or law enforcement.	none
We seek to help clarify those policies and gain better enforcement, as well as provide users with the power to filter what they experience.	none

@ChristophHeer52 @miskelayla The idea that the US is trying to provoke Russia in light of Russian invasion of Crimea and E. Ukr. is absurd.	none
@ChristophHeer52 @miskelayla Pilgars repetition of the Russian propaganda line about Ukrainian Nazis is an insufferable lie.	none
@ChristophHeer52 @miskelayla Pilgar is a lying low life piece of dog shit. And there is no other way to put it.	none
@ChristophHeer52 @miskelayla Pilgar sides with communists, authoritarian dictators, and terrorist in every single case.	none
@ChristophHeer52 @miskelayla Some day I will go out of my way to piss on his grave.	none
@MummyyJoy Anyone who believes that you can have compromise or power sharing with people of an absolutist Islamic mindset is delusional.	none
@nwOryzen @ChristophHeer52 There was no US coup in Ukraine, microbrain.	none
@joanneleon @ChristophHeer52 There were never any neo Nazis involved. That is simply Russian propaganda.	none
@joanneleon @ChristophHeer52 It goes on the assumption that the admiration of Stephan Bandera means support for a Nazi ideology. False.	none
@joanneleon @ChristophHeer52 First, Bandera fought for Nazis, but he was also in a Nazi prison.	none
@joanneleon @ChristophHeer52 Bandera's joining with Nazis was to rid Ukraine of Soviets, and had no relationship to him supporting ideology.	none
@joanneleon @ChristophHeer52 Same applies to 14th Waffen SS. They fought for Nazis to get rid of Soviets. They never had.....	none
@joanneleon @ChristophHeer52 ... Nazi ideological indoctrination. And wiki will tell you that half the world's neo Nazis live in Russia.	none

@nwOryzen @_DirtyTruths ROFL. You really do have more than one screw lose.	none
@_DirtyTruths Sanctions didn't kill anyone, birdbrain. There were no sanctions against Iraq buying food. You people are as deluded as ever.	none
@_DirtyTruths And you pick the same old lying scab until you finally die.	none
@PeterClifford1 Glad to hear that, Peter. And I will respect your assessment.	none
@_DirtyTruths The problem is in your lie that the deaths were caused by US sanctions. Purchase of food by Iraq was never sanctioned.	none

@MummyyJoy Sorry. Twitter missed on sending that tweet. Answer should now be present.	none
@_DirtyTruths Okay, microbrain, show me proof that the sanctions included food or medicine and stop babbling about experts.	none
@_DirtyTruths ROFL. Genocide denier? LOL. Okay, I didn't realize I was talking to the lunatic left fringe. Have a nice day.	none
@_DirtyTruths Wikipedia says that there were no sanctions against food and medicine. Try again, microbrain.	none
@_DirtyTruths Not only were there no sanctions against food and medicine, but Sadam was allowed to sell oil in exchange for food &amp; medicine.	none
@_DirtyTruths I guess while your trying to shove your sanctimoniousness at people you can't read your forehead.	none
@_DirtyTruths Who cares about some loony opinions. The facts are that there were no sanctions against food or medicine. Any idiot can verify	none
@_DirtyTruths You blabber on endlessly without presenting a single fact. Show where we sanctioned food and medicine or shut up.	none
@_DirtyTruths We are not arguing deaths. We are arguing the cause. Sadam was the cause, not sanctions.	none
@_DirtyTruths No, like the idiot leftist that you are, you believe that endless repetition constitutes truth.	none
@_DirtyTruths Just drone mindlessly on if you like. By now you could have actually brought some facts to the table. But you have none.	none
@_DirtyTruths Repeating "as everyone knows" is your way of saying that you just sit around and repeat the BS of your left wing clones.	none
@_DirtyTruths So where is your evidence of the intentional destruction of water. Give me a link to facts, not opinions.	none
@_DirtyTruths To divide?	none
@_DirtyTruths Again, like an idiot you give the opinions of people like you, with no facts.	none
@_DirtyTruths Printing some BS from an unsourced, US hating conspiracy nut like yourself does not constitute evidence of anything.	none
@MummyyJoy The Saudis pay for a lot of them.	none
@_DirtyTruths So at the moment, I'm busy trying to track down the sources of your conspiracy theories.	none
@_DirtyTruths The first one seems to come from the far left wing rag, The Progressive. The article is by Thomas Nagy.	none
@_DirtyTruths The article is called, "The Secret behind the Sanctions, How the US intentionally destroyed Iraq's water supply"	none
@_DirtyTruths Of the three papers that he references, I have so far only been able to locate the third.	none
@_DirtyTruths Here is the paper. http://t.co/zv46NuwUJL In reading it I find nothing to support the allegations.	none
@_DirtyTruths I'm going to continue looking for the other papers to see if they help his case or show it to be politically motivated.	none
@_DirtyTruths Certainly the paper shows that the idea that drinking water was the only or main health issue in Iraq is a lie.	none

@haroonstyles Okay, you had your chance at an honest discussion. Now you are blocked.	none
@MelBiebs69 @haroonstyles @halalflaws @greenlinerzjm @biebervalue Do we agree that Islam tells women to stay at home and not display?	none
@MelBiebs69 So when Taliban make women stay home and wear Burquas are they not implementing 33:33?	none
@AMohedin No it is only talking to women. So are the Taliban and ISIS and Saudis not implementing 33:33 when they force women home?	none
@AMohedin When the Taliban make women wear Burquas are they not preventing women from "displaying themselves"?	none
@halalflaws @AMohedin @islamdefense @haroonstyles @greenlinerzjm No, it says this. http://t.co/zpGYjCBUNb	none
@halalflaws @AMohedin @islamdefense @haroonstyles @greenlinerzjm Now show me the screen or photo of yours. Or type it.	none
@AMohedin Show me the verse where it says that it is forbidden to force people into doing something.	none
@halalflaws I don't see your 33:33. Only something about a house and can't breath. What does that have to do with 33:33.	none
@halalflaws @islamdefense @AMohedin @haroonstyles @greenlinerzjm This is your tweet. It is not 33:33. http://t.co/IBM4xjcoYd	none
@AMohedin Stop making up lies. Show me with a verse.	none
@AMohedin So now that we know that Islam tells women to stay at home, we can move on to the subject of forcing women to obey.	none
@AMohedin And here we have it. What does your 4:34 say? http://t.co/WqDcjxsTT4	none
@AMohedin @halalflaws @islamdefense @haroonstyles @greenlinerzjm Why?	none
@AMohedin @halalflaws @islamdefense @haroonstyles @greenlinerzjm What does your 4:34 say? Same as these? http://t.co/euBhAxWUDK	none
@AMohedin But the Quran says that verses can be abrogated, right? Now let's get to compulsion later. What does 4:34 say?	none
@halalflaws @islamdefense @AMohedin @haroonstyles @greenlinerzjm You are babbling. 33:33 says this. http://t.co/FbpPSnaLnD	none
@halalflaws @islamdefense Stay on 33:33 until we agree what it says. http://t.co/M53tWoA8cr	none
@halalflaws @haroonstyles @AMohedin @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm I read the whole. It doesn't change 33:33 at all.	none
@AMohedin No, it clearly says to beat them. The rest are other options. "Beat them" is there in black and white. Not what you say.	none
@AMohedin No, not going to bed with her is a seperate option. There is no "mentally".	none
@halalflaws @haroonstyles @AMohedin @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm Only two verses and we are making progress.	none
@AMohedin Okay, so let's try one more verse. What does your 2:282 say? http://t.co/OrYnUooi5n	none
@AMohedin @halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm So your claim is that me are physically superior, right?	none
@halalflaws @haroonstyles @AMohedin @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm Not talking about what you choose to do. I'm talking about what Islam says.	none
@AMohedin @halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm Beating her was not recommended, but allowed.	none
@halalflaws @haroonstyles @AMohedin @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm Actually he hit Aisha. But I don't have time for that now.	none
@halalflaws @AMohedin @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm What does your 2:282 say? http://t.co/hxSgcsx5fm	none
@AMohedin @halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm I would have to do a search, so let's forget that one for now.	none
@AMohedin @halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm You can deny it until I prove it.	none
@AMohedin It doesn't require muscles to be a witness. So can we assume the lack is mental or emotional.	none
@AMohedin @halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm And because of 4:34, beating would not be a reason in a Sharia court.	none
@AMohedin @halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm I've got 4 translations that say hit and one that says scourge.	none
@AMohedin @halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm Who's translation are you using?	none
@AMohedin We can get that much from the Quran. So maybe the Hadiths can help us clarify.	none
@AMohedin So these are Hadiths that I copied from the USC Muslim students Hadith database. Look them up for yourself. http://t.co/UdWmDtxxDw	none
@AMohedin @halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm Why do you think all the translators use strike?	none
@AMohedin Not unless you can get 5 professional translators to agree.	none
@halalflaws @haroonstyles @AMohedin @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm I got help. Five professional translators that all say strike.	none
@AMohedin But the five professional translators, many of them Muslims, do know Arabic. For some it is their first language.	none
@AMohedin Even Pickthall, who is an Englishman, was a Muslim convert.	none
@AMohedin 4:34 is in the Quran not the Hadith. And you don't explain why 5 translators would use strike.	none
@AMohedin @halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm The translators knew Arabic, so they are right.	none
@AMohedin @halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm The translations are on a Muslim web site and they say strike.	none
@AMohedin @halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm But let's go on to the Hadith that refers back to 2.282.	none
@AMohedin @halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm In that Hadith it says the reason is that women lack intelligence.	none
@AMohedin @halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm I'll give it to you again. http://t.co/8ov7jyscmm	none
@AMohedin @halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm So I decided to give you one more chance even beyond the 5 translators.	none
@AMohedin @halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm I cut out 4:34 in Arabic and stuck it into Google translate.	none
@AMohedin @halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm Here is a screen shot of what I got. http://t.co/562Ckt6sEZ	none
@AMohedin @halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm Google translate used the word "beat". I hope that settles it.	none
